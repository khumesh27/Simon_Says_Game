# Simon_Says_Game
"Simon Says" is a memory game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Four colored buttons light up in a random sequence, and the player must repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the correct order. With each round, the sequence grows longer, testing the playerâ€™s memory and focus. Simple design and logic make it fun and interactive!
